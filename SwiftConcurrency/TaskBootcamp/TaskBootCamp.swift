            // Adds an async task to perform before this view appears
            // Default priority is userInitiated
            // SwiftUI will automatically cancels the task if the view disappears before the action completes.
            // If you have a long task that is gonna take a long time to complete it might still continue doing some of those processes before it actually cancels
            // For example i have an async sequence inside an async function. Although the task could be cancelled the work in this task is still continuing. So the solution is occasionally in your code check for cancellation using Task.checkCancellation() which is a throwable function so if the task is cancelled it will throw an error
